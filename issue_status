Configurability
- Step 1
- Created the environment.gradle
- Added all application env with applicationId and different
version code and name
- Added different type of endpoint to manage auto build
- dynamically generate the build variant whenever change from
build variant window
- Add all resource, assets and logo on specific project folder
- Auto generate all base config as per build variant
- Selected namma build variant and build the project
- You can see the default Intelehealth app already installed in mobile
- Build and install namma app from same source code through build config
- You can see that launcher icon and color theme has been changed
- this are all one time setup config, next time you just need to add resource, logo, endpoint
and application id only
